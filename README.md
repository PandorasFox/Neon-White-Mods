# MorbedMod

This mod aims to just be a speedrunning mod that just displays some extra info (e.g. position, velocity) and, ideally, will be allowed in speedruns.

For now, this mod only contains a speedometer + position/facing direction text draw, but the goal is to have a handful of small modules that can be independently toggled on and off.

## Installation

This mod uses [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) as its modloader. Install that on your Neon White install first, and then run the game once so it generates some folders, and to verify it's installed (you should see a MelonLoader splash screen).

After that, grab the latest .dll from the [Releases page](https://github.com/PandorasFox/Neon-White-Mods/releases) and drop it in the "Mods" folder in your Neon White folder, e.g. `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Neon White\Mods`.

## Usage

For now, there is no configuration or anything. This just displays your position, facing direction, and movement velocities in the top-left corner in yellow.
